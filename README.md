# task-manager-api
A task manager API I developed to learn how to work with and create APIs using MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and Insomnia to test the various endpoints.

Install the relevant npm packages using `npm install`, then run the `npm run dev` script to run the application on the local host.

This application is hosted on a Heroku Dyno, so the endpoints can currently be accessed. The endpoints include CRUD operations for users and tasks as well as allowing users to uploade a profile picture.

The base url is `https://djimee-task-manager.herokuapp.com`, see the `src/routers` for the various endpoints that are available.
