# task-manager-api
A task manager API I developed to learn how to work with and create APIs - MongoDB, Express and Node.js

I used Insomnia in the development of this API, Postman could also be used to test it out.

Install the relevant npm packages using `npm install`, then run the `npm run dev` script to run the application on the local host.

This application is hosted on a Heroku Dyno, so the endpoints can currently be accessed.

The endpoints include CRUD operations for users and tasks, as well as allowing users to uploade a profile picture.

The base url is `https://djimee-task-manager.herokuapp.com`, see the `src/routers` for the various endpoints that are available.
